# nth Root of LCM(1..n) Convergence to e  
**Author**: [Choda Sai Chandra]  
**Description**: This C program computes \(\sqrt[n]{\text{LCM}(1..n)}\) and confirms the units stailizes at 2 for \(n = 7\), the first decimal stabilizes at 7 for \(n = 5,387\), the second decimal stabilizes at 1 for \(n = 618,444\), the third decimal stabilizes at 8 for \(n = 36,969,511\).  
**Key Findings**:
- Stabilization at n = 7 → **2.**...  
- Stabilization at n = 5,387 → 2.**7**...  
- Stabilization at n = 618,444 → 2.7**1**...  
- Stabilization at n = 36,969,511 → 2.71**8**...  
- Validates theoretical convergence to \(e \approx 2.718281828459\).
